# 🌟 Gemini AI Interface Revamp – Challenge Solved!

## 🎯 Objective  
This project is my submission for the **Gemini AI Interface Revamp Challenge**. The goal was to step into the future of UI design by leveraging **AI prompting** with Gemini to reimagine and rebuild a given interface using modern frontend technologies — and then deploy it live.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used  
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Bootstrap** (components and styles generated through Gemini AI prompting)
- **TypeScript** (for type safety and better development experience)

## 🧠 My Approach  
- I crafted and refined prompts to generate clean, reusable UI components using **Gemini AI**.  
- Used those components to build a visually appealing and responsive interface.  
- Customized and optimized the AI-generated code to ensure consistency and user-friendly design.  
- Finally, deployed the revamped site to **Vercel** for a seamless live experience.
